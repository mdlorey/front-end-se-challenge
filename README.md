# Front End Software Engineer Challenge

Welcome to the Front End Software Engineer Challenge!

This challenge consists of 3 exercises. The goal is to get a sense of how you solve problems and implement your code - the  questions are not designed to trick you.

No additional packages or libraries are required but you may add any that you wish.  Please do not modify the instructions component (found at `/src/pages/HomeInstructions. vue`) or any of the instruction text for the exercise (these will be clearly denoted in  the code with an `...__instructions` class) until your submission has been graded.  Any other code (including router, store, styling, and components) are free for you to modify at your discretion.

## Project setup

- Clone this repository
- Change the remote to a private GitHub repository under your username
- Push code to that remote, using clear Commits and Pull Requests with clear messages
- Code!

## Recommended IDE

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) (vscode extension) is registered as a workspace recommended extension. 

## Local Development

To start, install the project dependencies.

```
npm install
```


### Transpiles and hot-reloads for development

Then, start your development server.

```
npm run dev
```

### Lints and fixes files

This project is setup to use the same ESLint config our frontend developers actually use. https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prefecthq/eslint-config. The workspace settings (assuming you're using vscode) are setup to automatically fix any fixable eslint errors on save.
